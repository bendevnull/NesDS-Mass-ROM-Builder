# NesDS Mass ROM Builder
NesDS Mass ROM Builder is a Python script written
to assist those who are trying to inject multiple
ROMs into Apache Thunder's NesDS-Singles emulator
for the Nintendo DS.

## Prequisites
* Python 2.7 (3.1 might work but, Python 3 is overrated :P)
* DEVKITARM (To build the emulator after the ROM is ready)
* CMake
* A C++ compiler of some sort (I use MinGW on Windows)
* At least a single (1) gram of brain mass

## How to Use
1. Turn on your computer
2. Log into Windows or Linux
3. ~~Download~~ Legally obtain some NES ROMs
4. Put the ~~downloaded~~ ripped ROMs in the same folder as the script
5. I cannot stress this enough, **MAKE SURE CMAKE AND DEVKITARM ARE WORKING BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT! I DON'T WANT ANY ISSUES COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FACT SOME IDIOT CANNOT GET ONE OF THE TWO THINGS RUNNING!**
6. Run the script
7. Fill in any information about the ROM that the script asks for (Two pieces of info per ROM)
8. Enjoy your new NES games for your DS
9. (Optional) Use Gericom's DSPatch (Or my Python version when it's finished ;)) to inject your new ROMs into a DS Download Station ROM and then use a flashcart or TWLoader to play the games on your older DS systems.

## FAQ
* Q: What is DEVKITARM?
  * A: If you do not know this, you shouldn't be here. Instead, get a friend with at least one (1) gram of brain mass to help you use this script.
* Q: Why don't you like Python 3?
  * A: I just don't. Don't you have somewhere else to criticize people's opinions?
* Q: Do you know any other programming languages?
  * A: I've dabbled in a few other languages myself. (GML, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C, C#, etc.)
* Q: Now a question about this script, what other OSes does this script run on?
  * A: It could run on a toaster as long as said toaster has C++ compiling capabilities and a Python interpreter. Just don't forget to plug in your keyboard ;)
* Q: Is the name going to be final?
  * A: Perhaps unless someone comes up with something more creative.
* Q: Will you add more to this FAQ as people ask dumb questions?
  * A: Yes. I just didn't feel like coming up with any more questions of my own.
